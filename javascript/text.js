var poem = "I am on a small road a few miles outside of Broken Bow North Dakota I’ve never been here before I’ll likely never be here again " +

"It’s half an hour past noon though it feels almost as though the sun is setting " +

"A calmingly warm summer day there’s a cool breeze that picks frequently " +

"The sky is clear and the sun is gradually getting brighter " +

"The scent of the nearby corn field is occasionally interrupted with the burning of exhaust from passing trucks " +

"Although there are groups of people further down the road the wind keeps me serenely isolated " +

"The only sounds are the buzzing insects and the wind blowing through the cornstalks " +

"I’m watching the crescent lights in the shadow of the tree waxing as the minutes pass " +

"To my right is a dirt road that ends in a grassy area with farming equipment " +

"A corn field is to my left " +

"And the shadows ripple and dance along the gravel at my feet " +

"I know this road trip is coming to an end " +

"Behind me is the rental car that I have only nine hours to return " +

"Up ahead I see the larger road that begins my journey back home " +

"The solar eclipse is ending above me though I’m pretending that time has stopped " +

"And all this time there’s been a katydid crawling up my leg"
